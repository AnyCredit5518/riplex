# Consolidate riplex debug artifacts

## Problem

riplex currently writes 11 distinct JSON/log artifacts across multiple
locations with overlapping naming. The word "manifest" is overloaded
(production `_rip_manifest.json` vs. debug `riplex-rip.manifest.json`),
two debug writers (`save_rip_manifest`, `save_scan_snapshot`) have no
production readers, and the organize snapshot lives at the title root
instead of in `_riplex/` like the other debug files. The `_riplex/README.txt`
template lists files that may not actually be present.

A related bug: failed rips silently produce a `_rip_manifest.json` with
`"filename": ""` because `run_rip` checks `proc.returncode == 0` to
determine success, but `makemkvcon` returns 0 even on HashCheck failures.
Surfaced by a real failure on Matrix Reloaded Disc 1 (corrupt
`/BDMV/STREAM/00002.m2ts`).

## Affected users

Anyone filing bug reports (confused about which JSON to attach), anyone
inspecting their rip output (unclear what each file is for), anyone
re-running organize on a failed rip (manifest claims success).

## Workaround

None — symptom is cosmetic confusion plus the failed-rip status bug,
which can be diagnosed by reading `_makemkvcon_tNN.log` directly.

## Proposed fix

### Target artifact layout

**Per-disc folder** (production + per-title logs):

- `Disc N/<canonical>_tNN.mkv` — actual rip
- `Disc N/_rip_manifest.json` — production; gains a per-title `status`
  field (`"success"` | `"failed"` | `"cancelled"`) plus `error_message`
  for failures, and top-level `success_count` / `failed_count`
- `Disc N/_makemkvcon_tNN.log` — stays here (per-title, too noisy for
  the title-level debug folder)

**Title-root `_riplex/`** (single home for all debug):

- `riplex-rip.snapshot.json` — rip pipeline state (TMDb match,
  dvdcompare, selected/ripped titles, phase)
- `riplex-organize.snapshot.json` — **renamed and moved** from
  `<Title>.snapshot.json` at title root
- `organized.json` — already lives here, unchanged
- `riplex.log` — CLI session log, unchanged
- `README.txt` — rewritten to match what's actually written

**User-data folder** (`~/.../riplex/`) — unchanged:

- `riplex_app.log` — GUI runtime log
- `crashes/crash-*.txt` — GUI crash dumps

**Removed entirely**:

- `_riplex/riplex-rip.manifest.json` — duplicate of production manifest,
  no readers
- `_riplex/riplex-scan.snapshot.json` — aborted parallel mechanism, no
  production readers (only tests)

### Implementation phases

1. **Manifest status field.** Real success detection in `run_rip` (parse
   `MSG:5004,...,"N titles saved, M failed"` summary line). Update
   `build_rip_manifest` to include all attempted titles with `status` +
   `error_message`. `build_scanned_from_manifests` skips non-success
   entries. `load_manifest` defaults `status` to `"success"` when
   missing for back-compat. Independent of other phases. (Partially
   implemented: `_parse_rip_summary` already added in
   `src/riplex/disc/makemkv.py`.)

2. **Consolidate organize snapshot.** New path
   `_riplex/riplex-organize.snapshot.json`. `snapshot.py::load()` falls
   back to legacy `<Title>.snapshot.json` for old folders (no
   migration). Updates callers in `organize.py` and
   `organize_preview.py`. Independent of phase 1.

3. **Remove dead writers.** Delete `snapshot.py::save_rip_manifest()`
   and `snapshot.py::save_scan_snapshot()` plus their callers. Drop
   corresponding tests. Depends on phase 2.

4. **Docs + README template.** Rewrite `_README_TEXT` in `snapshot.py`
   to match reality. New "Output Artifacts" section in
   `docs/architecture.md` with the full table (production vs debug,
   location, writer, reader, safe-to-delete). Dated entry in
   `docs/changelog.md`. Same commit as phases 2-3 so docs match code.

5. **Patch version bump** per repo convention.

### Decisions locked

- Heavy scope: consolidate file locations + rename + remove dead code +
  docs (not just docs)
- "manifest" reserved for production data; debug duplicate is deleted,
  not renamed
- Both `save_rip_manifest` and `save_scan_snapshot` removed
- `_makemkvcon_tNN.log` stays in per-disc folder (too noisy/per-title to
  belong alongside the higher-level pipeline snapshots)
- Failed rips DO get a `_rip_manifest.json` entry with `status: "failed"`
- No migration tool for old organize snapshots — `load()` just tries new
  path first, falls back to legacy

### Verification

1. `pytest` — existing tests pass; new tests for status field +
   legacy snapshot fallback
2. Fresh GUI rip → output dirs contain only files in the north-star
   list above
3. Cancel a rip mid-way → manifest has `status: "cancelled"` entry
4. Re-rip Matrix Reloaded Disc 1 (the damaged disc that prompted this)
   → manifest has `status: "failed"` with `error_message` populated
5. Run organize against a folder containing legacy
   `<Title>.snapshot.json` → loads via fallback
6. Open `_riplex/README.txt` in a finished session → matches files
   actually present
7. Visual: title folder structure matches `docs/architecture.md` table
   exactly

### Out of scope

- User-data log locations (`riplex_app.log`, crash dumps)
- Migration tool for old `<Title>.snapshot.json` (just fallback-read)
- v1/v2 snapshot envelope format (already supported by `load`)
- `_makemkvcon_tNN.log` location/format
- GUI changes beyond the manifest status fix already started
